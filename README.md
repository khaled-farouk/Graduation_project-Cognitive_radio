SoC Based FPGA Implementation of A Complete Cognitive Cooperative Spectrum Sensing System
Due to the repaid development in wireless technology, such as IoT WSN and 5 G, the demand for wireless
communication has increased and the current standard can’t fulfill this demand Cognitive radio ( is a promising
technology that improves the spectrum utilization efficacy CR is an intelligent network that has cognitive and
reconfigurable capabilities, therefore it’s can adapt itself to the changes in spectrum environment The main aspect of
CR is spectrum sensing In this project, a SoC based FPGA implementation of a complete high performance cooperative
spectrum sensing system is proposed Our system is divided to 5 Subsystems sensing, user selection, data fusion and
hypotheses testing, cooperation model and channel control and reporting Various schemes for cooperative spectrum
sensing are reviewed and the challenges associated with it, such as detection probability, false alarm probability,
cooperation overhead, power efficiency, sensing time and system security and complexity In this project we choose
the best schemes that optimally and practically solve this challenges
